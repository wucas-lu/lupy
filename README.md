# Lupy

General purpose Luau to Python 3 transpiler.

Lupy parses Luau abstract syntax trees to emit functionally similar structures
in Python so that the code stays the same.

## But Whyâ€½

VEX Robotics only offers two real languages: C++ and Python. Nobody likes the
former, while the latter lacks static typings. Lupy tries to bridge this gap
using Luau, which brings a gradual structured type system to Lua.

I need a pysch eval and I should go back to doing homework.
